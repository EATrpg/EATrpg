      <p>I am an English as a second / foreign language teacher. There are a few things I was before, but none relevant enough to include in this conversation besides the fact that I was and still am an avid video gamer. The primary draw for me is their ability to not only show you a world, but allow you to experience it firsthand. You get to interact with this world in a way that is not achievable through other media such as television, film or novels.</p>

      <p>As a teacher, I am always looking for ways to push student engagement and motivation. A common buzzword being flung around often these days is <a id ="gamification" href="docs/K.Wertman-GamifyingJapaneseEFL.pdf" target="_blank">“gamification”</a> (this is a more detailed explanation in a Japanese EFL context, but provides an overview in ESL/EFL as well). Some describe it as including game-like elements to motivate people in other contexts. In an educational context, it goes beyond merely playing games and has evolved into a way to think about your design methodology…Rather than going into a long winded write up on this topic, I would like to jump to the project I had in mind when I build this site.</p> 
 
    <img class="image-fluid rounded float-right" src="images/ipad-3765920_1920.jpg" alt="quizlet">
    <p>Basically, I have seen and used countless games that teach English. Video, board, online, offline, apps and everything in between. Which brings me to my current interest in tabletop roleplaying games (TRPGs). For the last year, I have been both an active player and dungeon master of the most recognizable TRPGs, Dungeons and Dragons...</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">WAIT! NO! HEAR ME OUT! IT’S COOL NOW!</p>
    <br>  
      <p>Yeah, seriously check out this video of Joe Manganiello's <a id="HollywoodD&D" href="https://youtu.be/KdUSja1afjE" target="_blank">Hollywood celebrity D&D club</a>. Or you might not have to, if you are a fan of Netflix’s Stranger Things. Though, I bet if you have read this far you might even be a Critter (a fan of Critical Role, a D&D live play show, on the game streaming platform, Twitch). The game is enjoying a massive popularity boost in recent years. Hopefully, you know enough about the game to understand what I am proposing below. If not, check <a id="D&Dexplination" href="https://youtu.be/2PEt5RdNHNw" target="_blank">this video</a> (waring, mild language *censored*) out for an explanation.</p>

      <p>Anway, back on point. The only thing that outshines my video game and TRPG geekery is my  educational theory nerdism. Applying what I know about curriculum design, four strands integration, gamification, second language acquisition and other words on my ten dollar word list of jargon, I see nothing but untapped potential in the classroom. In a communicative classroom we often have students roleplay shopping and asking for directions as somewhat tenuously connected exercises in part of a larger unit. In a TRPG, these are baked in as necessary parts of the game. Good group cooperation and interaction are required in order to have a successful game.  TRPGs could be gold mines (which, taken literally, might be a fun adventure hook for English learners [ELs]) for any input or output activity. Not only do they require speaking and listening skills during the game, but these games demand writing and reading skills. Players are encouraged to write backstories for their characters and read rules. In game, they might even get a letter from a king. They might even be asked to pen a response. Great TRPG players are encouraged to take notes and be active listeners to say involved with the game. You might even have players that become comfortable enough with the rules to become a dungeon or game master themselves. If they are taking up the mantle of running a game, then they will certainly need to put those reading and writing skills to use.</p>
   
      <p>I know what you are thinking... Isn’t D&D complicated and difficult to play? The game is known for its complexity, even for native English speakers. Of course there are many hurdles that need to be overcome in order to make the game manageable for ELs. Furthermore, I am not saying play D&D with your ELs. There are in fact many other popular TRPGs. Many use much simpler rule sets...However, most were designed for players that have a full command of the language of play. What I am proposing is designing a TRPG with ELs in mind. I have done a bit of research and we’ll start diving into more specifics of development in my next post.</p>

      <p>Hold your appetite. It might be awhile until we find a good EAT (English Adventure Table).</p>
